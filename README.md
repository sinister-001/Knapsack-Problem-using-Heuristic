# Knapsack-Problem-using-Heuristic

#### In this repository we are going to see how to solve Knapsack Problem using Heuristic Approach.
#### Here I have used Simulated Annealing as my Heurisitc Approach to solve this *Binary Knapsack*. We will go through the Simulated Annealing detailed in this repository.
## Simulated Annealing
####The algorithm is inspired by annealing in metallurgy where metal is heated to a high temperature quickly, then cooled slowly, which increases its strength and makes it easier to work with.

The annealing process works by first exciting the atoms in the material at a high temperature, allowing the atoms to move around a lot, then decreasing their excitement slowly, allowing the atoms to fall into a new, more stable configuration.
